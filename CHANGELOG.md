## 2026-05-26 — Tester verification contract

Adds the mandatory **Tester Runtime + Static Verification Contract**. Both
the lightweight `verifier` (tiny/small/medium) and the full `tester`
(large/critical) must satisfy it on every run. The contract is project-
agnostic and ships with the package — installing this kit into a new Unity
project applies the contract automatically the first time `/team` runs.

### Added
- `.claude/skills/qa-validation/verification-contract.md` — canonical
  contract. Sections 1–7 cover static verification (compile + architecture
  safety), runtime verification (PlayMode → EditMode → repro scene →
  checklist), DOTS-specific testing rules, the editor compile safety gate,
  required output format, schema mapping, and the "explicitly impossible"
  exemption clause.

### Changed
- `.claude/skills/qa-validation/SKILL.md` — front-matter callout pointing
  to the contract; both verification agents inherit it.
- `.claude/skills/tester/SKILL.md` — sign-off now requires both layers;
  contract added to the Reference list.
- `.claude/skills/verifier/SKILL.md` — procedure extended from 5 to 6
  steps (static layer first); BLOCKED on broken compilation; result
  artifact now includes `static_verification` and `runtime_verification`
  blocks.
- `.claude/schemas/verification_result.schema.json` — added optional
  `static_verification` and `runtime_verification` objects (backward
  compatible; required by the contract unless §7 exemption is recorded in
  `notes`).

### Migration
- Existing `verification_result.json` artifacts remain valid (new fields
  are optional in the schema).
- New runs that omit either layer without a recorded §7 reason should be
  rejected by the verification agent itself (`status="BLOCKED"`); the
  schema does not enforce this — the contract does.

## 2026-05-25 — v2: Adaptive Pipeline (breaking)

Full redesign. The fixed 4-agent template is removed in favor of an adaptive
pipeline driven by a triage agent and enforced by a Python orchestrator.

### Breaking
- `/team` flag set replaced. `--bug | --feature | --refactor | --fast | --full
  | --fast-fix | --teams` are gone. New form: `/team <intent> [depth] <task>`
  where `intent ∈ {bug, feature, refactor, explore}` and
  `depth ∈ {quick, normal, deep}`. See `MIGRATION.md` for the 1:1 mapping.
- Fixed 4-agent spawn is removed. Pipeline composition is now derived per
  task from `workspace/triage.json` by `orchestrate.py plan`.
- Markdown-only gates removed. Every phase boundary is now
  `python .claude/scripts/orchestrate.py gate <phase-id>` and exits non-zero
  to halt.
- `tester` is no longer always-on. New lightweight `verifier` agent runs the
  deterministic verification bundle from `impl_result.json` for tiny/small/
  medium. `tester` is spawned only for `large`/`critical` complexity, when
  confidence < 0.7, or when depth=deep.
- `/team bugfix` subcommand removed (subsumed by `/team bug`).
- `.claude/skills/start-unity-dots-team/` removed (no fixed team to start).
- Nested subagents removed: `code-generator`, `job-optimizer`,
  `burst-validator`, `memory-checker`, `design-analyzer`,
  `dependency-mapper`. Their guidance is now loaded as skill packs.

### Added
- `.claude/scripts/orchestrate.py` — runtime enforcer with subcommands
  `preflight | reset | validate | plan | gate | ownership-check | finalize`.
  Stdlib only. Exit codes are the contract.
- `.claude/scripts/triage.py` — helper that emits a schema-valid
  `workspace/triage.json`.
- `.claude/schemas/` — JSON-schemas for every artifact
  (`triage`, `root_cause`, `approved_plan`, `impl_result`,
  `verification_result`, `ownership`).
- `.claude/workspace-templates/*.json` — canonical empty artifacts.
- `.claude/agents/triage.md`, `.claude/agents/verifier.md` — new subagent_types.
- `.claude/skills/triage/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/verifier/SKILL.md` — new.
- `.claude/skills/burst-safety/SKILL.md`,
  `.claude/skills/ecs-job-patterns/SKILL.md`,
  `.claude/skills/memory-safety/SKILL.md`,
  `.claude/skills/ownership-partitioning/SKILL.md` — skill packs replacing
  the v1 nested subagents.
- `MIGRATION.md` — v1 → v2 migration guide.
- `workspace/ownership.lock.json` — partition lock enforced by
  `orchestrate.py ownership-check`.

### Changed
- `.claude/commands/team.md` — full rewrite as an adaptive, gated command.
- `SETUP.md` — rewritten around install + verify; no more boot ceremony.
- `README.md` — rewritten around the adaptive pipeline.
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — replaces "spawn 4 agents in parallel" rules with
  pipeline-derived agent composition; documents new gates and skill packs.
