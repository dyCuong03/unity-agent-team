  Load when the task requires: Sample/demo skills for API connectivity testing and beginner examples — create primitive cubes/spheres, move/rotate/scale by name, delete by name, simple scene info. Use for smoke tests, health checks, and demo flows; not for production work. Unity Editor must be running with the unity-skills REST server reachable at http://localhost:8090.
do-not-use-when: |-
  Do not load when Unity Editor is not running locally. Do not load when unity-skills REST server is unreachable at http://localhost:8090. For actual GameObject operations → use `gameobject` module instead. For server health check → use `Python helper's` module instead.

# Sample Skills

Basic examples for testing the API.

## Guardrails

**Operating Mode** (v1.9 three-tier):
- **Approval** (default): query skills (`get_scene_info`, `find_objects_by_name`) run directly. Creators/mutators (`create_cube`, `create_sphere`, `set_object_position`, `set_object_rotation`, `set_object_scale`) are FullAuto — on `MODE_RESTRICTED`, run the grant protocol.
- **Auto** / **Bypass**: SemiAuto and FullAuto run directly.
- Auto-forbidden in this module: `delete_object` (`SkillOperation.Delete`). It is reachable only under Bypass or via a user-managed Allowlist entry; the grant flow returns `MODE_FORBIDDEN`.

**DO NOT** (common hallucinations):
- Sample skills are basic test/demo skills — do not use them for production work
- `sample_create` is a simplified version of `gameobject_create` — prefer the full gameobject module
- `sample_hello` / `sample_ping` are connectivity test skills only

**Routing**:
- For actual GameObject operations → use `gameobject` module
- For server health check → use Python helper's `unity_skills.health()`

## Skills

### create_cube
Create a cube primitive.
**Parameters:** `x`, `y`, `z`, `name`

### create_sphere
Create a sphere primitive.
**Parameters:** `x`, `y`, `z`, `name`

### delete_object
Delete object by name.
**Parameters:** `objectName`

### `find_objects_by_name`
Find objects containing string.
**Parameters:** `nameContains` (`name` is also accepted as a compatibility alias)

### `set_object_position`
Set object position.
**Parameters:** `objectName`, `x`, `y`, `z`

### `set_object_rotation`
Set object rotation.
**Parameters:** `objectName`, `x`, `y`, `z`

### `set_object_scale`
Set object scale.
**Parameters:** `objectName`, `x`, `y`, `z`

### `get_scene_info`
Get current scene information.
**Parameters:** None.
